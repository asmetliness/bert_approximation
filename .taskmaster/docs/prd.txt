# BERT Approximation Model - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
This project aims to develop a lightweight neural network that approximates BERT's CLS embeddings for dense retrieval tasks. The core innovation is using pre-computed embeddings of n-grams and skip-grams from a curated vocabulary to achieve BERT-like semantic understanding with significantly reduced computational overhead. The target is to achieve 10-100x faster inference than BERT while maintaining >95% of the retrieval quality.

The project addresses the computational bottleneck in dense retrieval systems where BERT's quadratic attention complexity becomes prohibitive for real-time applications. By shifting the heavy semantic encoding to an offline preprocessing step and using a lightweight aggregation model online, we can enable high-throughput semantic search in production environments.

## Core Features

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges

**Risk:** Training instability or convergence issues
**Mitigation:** Implement learning rate scheduling, gradient clipping, and multiple initialization strategies. Use teacher embedding normalization and multiple loss functions.

**Risk:** Inference speed may not meet target improvements
